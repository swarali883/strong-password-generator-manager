# strong-password-generator-manager

This Password Manager is used to store and generate password. 
For example, if I wanted to create account on Amazon as shown in fig below, then I enter the name of the website, email and use the 
bult in ‘Generate Password’ button which generates a complex and long password with all the required numbers and symbols. And once I 
have done with that, I just click ‘Add’ button and I get pop up which confirm with the information I entered. And after I click ‘Yes’, 
that data gets added text file that I have in my computer. So, this is not internet-based service so you can keep everything locally 
in your computer which some people feel a lot safer than using any third-party app to save password. And whenever I would need to log 
into that particular website, I could simply go the text file that saved my passwords. And it got some basic validations froe g, if 
you leave some field empty and directly click ‘Add’ button, you get a pop up saying ‘Don’t leave any fields empty!’
